                        <!-- <p class="lead"></p> -->
                        <p> Darshpun is the new form of a new modern business. Which is known in the world of internet as Multi Level Marketing. 
                            According to a survey in our country, about 7 percent of the country’s population uses the internet facility. 
                            The remaining 93 percent of the rest of the world are not fully aware of the vast majority of internet, That’s why the country is 
                            much more progressing than us. Any information is immediately available on one click on the internet. While we have been quite 
                            backward in these developing countries. Because of which we are being deprived of any facilities. And we have to make the pocket 
                            much slower to buy any product during this inflation period. In view of this problem, we have decided to provide income by giving 
                            some digital products at affordable prices.
